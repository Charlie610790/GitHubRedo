GitHubRedo

This was another assignment to recreate a website.  I was assigned to recreate the repos page of github.  This was not only another assignment using CSS and HTML but the first time usefully implementing Bower and Underscore to create templates to use with GitHub APIs and pulled into our website page using JSON.  This code was refactored and cleaned up nice.
